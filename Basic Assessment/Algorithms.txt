An algorithm is a sequential procedure to solve a particular problem.

Properties of an algorithm : 
- An algorithm has a finite number of steps.
- An algorithm should be robust. Less time and space complexity.

Why we need algorithms : 
- To get a clear overview of the particular problem.

Q. Write an algorithm to find all the prime numbers in the range {2,...,n}, where n is the nth element.

    S1. Start
    S2. input(n)
    S3. for(i = 3; i <= n; i = i+2)
    S4.     for(j = 3; j <= sqrt(i); j = j+2)
    S5.         if(i % j == 0)
    S6.             count++
    S7.             break
    S8.     if(count == 0)? print(i)

Q. Write a ROBUST algorithm to find all the prime numbers in the range {2,...,n}, where n is the nth element.
